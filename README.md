# Loadify

Loadify is an iOS and iPad app for downloading high-quality YouTube videos. You can copy and paste the URL of any video or shorts and download it in the quality of your choice.

This application uses [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core) under the hood to interact with YouTube.

- iPadOS 14.0+

- Low (320p)
- Medium (720p)

> **Note**\
> Currently, Loadify can only download videos from YouTube. The next iteration will include audio and video downloads from other sites such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.
